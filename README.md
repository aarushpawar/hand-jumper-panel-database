## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher (Python 3.8 reached EOL in October 2024)
- pip (Python package manager)
- Git
- A modern web browser

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/hand-jumper-database.git
   cd hand-jumper-database
   ```

2. **Install Python dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the scraping pipeline** (in order)
   ```bash
   cd scraper

   # Step 1: Download episodes (may take a while)
   python scrape_webtoon.py

   # Step 2: Extract individual panels
   python extract_panels.py

   # Step 3: Create web-optimized versions
   python optimize_images.py

   # Step 4: Scrape wiki data for autocomplete
   python scrape_wiki.py

   # Step 5: Build the final database
   python build_database.py
   ```

4. **Copy web-optimized images to frontend**
   ```bash
   # Windows
   xcopy /E /I ..\data\panels_web ..\frontend\images

   # Linux/Mac
   cp -r ../data/panels_web/* ../frontend/images/
   ```

5. **Open the site locally**
   - Open `frontend/index.html` in your browser
   - Or use a local server:
     ```bash
     cd frontend
     python -m http.server 8000
     # Visit http://localhost:8000
     ```

## 🏷️ Tagging Panels

1. Open `frontend/tagging.html` in your browser
2. Select a panel from the left sidebar
3. Add tags:
   - **Characters**: Who appears in the panel
   - **Locations**: Where the scene takes place
   - **Tags**: General tags (dialogue, action, essence-use, etc.)
   - **Emotions**: Emotional tone of the panel
   - **Notes**: Additional context
4. Click "Save & Next" to tag multiple panels quickly
5. Tagged data is saved as JSON files in `data/manual_tags/`
6. Run `build_database.py` again to incorporate new tags

## 🌐 Deployment

See [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) for detailed deployment instructions.

**Quick deploy to GitHub Pages:**

1. Push your repository to GitHub
2. Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings
3. Deploy the `frontend/` directory
4. Your site will be live at `https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/REPO-NAME/`

**Note**: Due to GitHub's file size limits, you may need to use Git LFS for image files. See DEPLOYMENT.md for details.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
